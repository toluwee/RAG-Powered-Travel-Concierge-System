evaluator = TravelSystemEvaluator()

# Create custom test case
custom_test = {
    "test_id": "custom_scenario_1",
    "category": "luxury_business_trip",
    "user_query": "Plan a luxury business trip to Tokyo with first-class flights",
    "constraints": ["first-class flights", "5-star hotels", "budget unlimited"],
    "expected_flights": 1,
    "expected_hotels": 1,
    "complexity": "high"
}

# Add to test data
evaluator.test_data.append(custom_test)
```

### A/B Testing

Compare different model versions:

```python
# Evaluate model version A
model_a_results = await evaluator.evaluate_fine_tuned_model()

# Switch to model version B
evaluator.model_trainer.load_fine_tuned_model("models/version_b")
model_b_results = await evaluator.evaluate_fine_tuned_model()

# Compare results
improvement = model_b_results.accuracy - model_a_results.accuracy
print(f"Model B improvement: {improvement:.3f}")
```

### Performance Monitoring

Set up continuous evaluation:

```python
import schedule
import time

def run_daily_evaluation():
    asyncio.run(evaluator.run_comprehensive_evaluation())

# Schedule daily evaluation
schedule.every().day.at("02:00").do(run_daily_evaluation)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)
```

### Benchmarking

Compare against industry standards:

```python
# Industry benchmarks
industry_benchmarks = {
    "model_accuracy": 0.85,
    "rag_retrieval_accuracy": 0.88,
    "personalization_score": 0.82,
    "response_time": 2.5
}

# Compare your results
your_results = await evaluator.run_comprehensive_evaluation()
summary = your_results["summary"]

for metric, benchmark in industry_benchmarks.items():
    your_score = summary["component_scores"].get(metric, 0)
    performance = "Above" if your_score > benchmark else "Below"
    print(f"{metric}: {performance} industry average ({your_score:.3f} vs {benchmark:.3f})")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Evaluation**: Run evaluations weekly or after major changes
2. **Baseline Comparison**: Always compare against previous versions
3. **User Feedback**: Incorporate real user feedback when available
4. **A/B Testing**: Test improvements before full deployment
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up automated monitoring
6. **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of evaluation results
7. **Iterative Improvement**: Use evaluation results to guide improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model Not Found Error**:
- Ensure the fine-tuned model is properly saved
